# S - Single Responsibility

- [SOLID principles](README.md)

Each class/method(function) should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality. Less functionality -> fewer dependencies and far fewer component test cases.

```java
public class PasswordHasher
{
    public String hashAndSavePassword(String password)
    {
        hashPassword();
        savePassword();
    }

    public void hashPassword()
    {
        //hashing implementation
    }
    public void savePassword()
    {
        //save to the db
    }
}
```

It should not be its responsibility to save them to the database.
