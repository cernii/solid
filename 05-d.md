# D - Dependency Inversion (Injection)

- [SOLID principles](README.md)

Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

We have a password service:

```java
public class PasswordService
{
    private Base64Hasher hasher = new Base64Hasher();
    void hashPassword(String password)
    {
        hasher.hashPassword(password);
    }
}
```

We violated the principle since we tightly coupled the Base64Hasher and PasswordService.

Let the client inject the hasher service needed with the constructor:

```java
public class PasswordService
{
    private PasswordHasher passwordHasher;
    
    public PasswordService(PasswordHasher passwordHasher)
    {
        this.passwordHasher = passwordHasher;
    }
    
    void hashPassword(String password)
    {
        this.passwordHasher.hashPassword(password);
    }
}
```

Much better. We can easily change the hashing algorithm. Our service does not care about the algorithm, it's up to the client to choose it. We donâ€™t depend on the concrete implementation, but the abstraction.
