# L - Liskov Substitution

- [SOLID principles](README.md)

A sub-class should be able to fulfill each feature of its parent class and could be treated as its parent class.

```java
public abstract class Hashed
{
    PasswordHasher passwordHasher;
    String hash;
    
    public void generateHash(String password)
    {
        hash = passwordHasher.hashPassword(password);
    }
}
```

```java
public class Base64 extends Hashed
{
    public Base64()
    {
        this.passwordHasher = new Base64Hasher();
    }
}
```

To fulfill Liskov’s Rule, each other extension of Hashed should use a valid implementation of hashing function and return a hash.

If we extend the Hashed class with a class called “NoHash” that uses an implementation that returns exactly the same password without any encoding will break the rule, since a subclass of Hashed is expected to have a hashed value of the password.
