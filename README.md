# The Principles :blue_book:

![Up to Date](https://github.com/cernii/solid/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)

- S. :point_right: **Single Responsibility** - Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with the
 excessive functionality.

- O. :point_right: **Open Closed** - Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. In other words
, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

- L. :point_right: **Liskov Substitution** - This means that every subclass or derived class should be
 substitutable for their base or parent class.

- I. :point_right: **Interface Segregation** - Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do
. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

- D. :point_right: **Dependency Inversion** - Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
