## SOLID - principles of object-oriented design

- [S - Single Responsibility](01-s.md) - Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with the
 excessive functionality.
- [O - Open-Close](02-o.md) - Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. In other words
, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.
- [L - Liskov Substitution](03-l.md) - This means that every subclass or derived class should be
 substitutable for their base or parent class.
- [I - Interface Segregation](04-i.md) - Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do
. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.
- [D - Dependency Inversion (Injection)](05-d.md) - Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

**Q:** Why we should consider them when designing software?

**A:** Design principles encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software.
