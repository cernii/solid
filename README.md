- **Single Responsibility** - Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with the
 excessive functionality.

- **Open Closed** - Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. In other words
, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

- **Liskov Substitution** - This means that every subclass or derived class should be
 substitutable for their base or parent class.

- **Interface Segregation** - Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do
. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

- **Dependency Inversion** - Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
